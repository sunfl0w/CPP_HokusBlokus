#### Short description of CPP_Tracer
CPP_HokusBlokus is a implementation of the game Blokus for the Software-Challange Germany 2020/2021. The software will make extensive use of bitsets and bit operators.
There is a chance that parallel processing might be implemented to boost performance using a multi core processor or a GPU. This will not help on the server of the SCG but will make life a lot easier for people wanting a fast software for rapid testing and training of computer clients. Either way the software will as always be optimized to the limit and as far as my programming knowledge will take me :D

#### Suggestions and cooperation
I will gladly take any bugreports or feedback on the software. If you want to help improve the code, then feel free to do so.

#### Note
This project is actively worked on. Releases will be made when everyting is somewhat working.
